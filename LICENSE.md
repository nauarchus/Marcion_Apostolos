## Licenses & Terms of Re-Use

All data and code in this repo are copyright Â© 2024 Mark G. Bilby, Jack Bull, and K. Lance Lotharp unless otherwise noted in the files. 

The first three of these normalized datasets were peer-reviewed and published in the *Journal of Open Humanites Data* and deposited in the Harvard Dataverse. Use of the datasets archived in the Harvard Dataverse remains subject to the license terms elaborated in those respective locations.

The last two of these normalized datasets are being submitted for publication. No commercial or derivative uses may be made from them, and they should only be cited as forthcoming, and not cited at a granular level, since they are subject to change until the print publications materialize.

Files in this repo reflect further corrections, refinements, and transformations beyond those previous publications. Licenses for these follow-on works are indicated in the following table. All other rights reserved.
