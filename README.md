## Description

A repository dedicated to hosting expert-curated, normalized, and enriched datasets of the Apostolos/Apostolikon of Marcion of Sinope.

## Licenses & Terms of Re-Use

See the [Licenses](https://github.com/nauarchus/Marcion_Apostolos/blob/main/LICENSE.md) page in this repo for detailed information about dataset licenses and terms of reuse.

## File Types and Encodings

Each dataset currently has four manifestations:
* .txt file with human-readable Greek and each verse having its own row
* .txt file with words lemmatized and morphologically tagged following the BibleWorks Greek Morphology schema
* .xml file formatted according to the conventions of the Perseus Digital Library
* .csv "sprout" file that combines the three types of data above, assigning tokens to punctuation for sentence segmentation

All datasets use UTF-8 encoding and composed Unicode characters. When comparing these datasets with datasets that use decomposed unicode characters (such as GLAUx and Opera Graeca Adnotata), it may be necessary to convert between composed and decomposed characters for best results.
